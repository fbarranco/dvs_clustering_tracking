Release 1.0.3 - 28.03.2016
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
- davis_fx2.c: removed specific FX2 code, now uses same backend as FX3
  for sending all configuration values, due to new firmware version 3
  for FX2 DAVIS small-board cameras. A firmware update is required,
  please follow the instructions at http://inilabs.com/support/reflashing/.

NEW FEATURES
- frame.h: add function caerFrameEventGetPixelArrayCGFormat() to
  Frame Event, allows to get a copy of the pixels array in the
  standard computer graphics format (pixel (0, 0) in upper left
  corner) efficently.
- davis.h: add DAVIS_CONFIG_APS_ADC_TEST_MODE parameter to APS module.

Release 1.0.2 - 08.01.2016
IMCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
- frame.h: rename channel number to color channels and add color
  filter information, to better specify the information needed
  to reconstruct color frames. The 'enum caer_frame_event_color_channels'
  and 'enum caer_frame_event_color_filter' hold the possible values.
  This change is backwards-compatible with older frame format!
- davis.h, dvs128.h: changed info data structure's integers to be
  signed for better cross-language compatibility. Also 'deviceID'
  can now be compared directly with 'sourceID' from event packets.
- davis.h: changed type of 'apsColorFilter' in info data structure
  to take advantage of new 'enum caer_frame_event_color_filter'.

NEW FEATURES
- common.h: add generic functions for event packet copying, with
  support for packet size reductions (copy only valid).
- libcaer.h: add generic clear, get and set functions for bitfields,
  and use them in all the event functions to avoid errors.
- config.h: add device configuration event type, for tracking
  of device configuration changes in the event stream.
- log.c: add timezone information to log message time information.
- dvs128_simple.cpp, davis_simple.cpp: add C++11 example variants.
- Enable more Clang compiler warnings.

BUG FIXES
- davis_common.c: only update the ROI size information if ROI
  updates actually came in from the device.
- Fix and improve documentation, especially for the frame event.
- Fix off-by-one in event's GetEvent() function's warning log message.
- device.c: mark global function pointer arrays static.
- common.h, frame.h: fix compilation of inline functions in
  strict C++11 mode.


Release 1.0.1 - 06.11.2015
INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES
- Requires firmware version 2 and logic revision 7449.
- usb.h: improved caerDeviceDataStart() API to also allow for
  notification of data acquisition shutdown, to be able to react
  to abnormal shutdown cases, like when a device is unplugged.
- frame.h: changed in-memory format for easier handling and compatibility
  with the other event formats (all-in-one memory block).
- davis.h: rename DAVIS240 APSOVERFLOWLEVEL to APSOVERFLOWLEVELBN.

NEW FEATURES
- Headers are C++ compatible and stand-alone now.
- MacOS X support.
- Added pkg-config file for library.
- Full API documentation (see docs/ for PDF).
- Various cmake/build improvements. Support out-of-tree builds.
- Add iterator macros for EventPackets.
- frame.h: added ROI region ID tracking, as well as ROI position.
  Added caerFrameEventGetExposureLength() and caerFrameEventGetTimestamp(),
  which is defined as the median of the exposure times.
  Added caerFrameEventPacketGetPixelsSize() and caerFrameEventPacketGetPixelsMaxIndex()
  for EventPacket-level size information.
  Added caerFrameEventGetPixelsSize() and caerFrameEventGetPixelsMaxIndex()
  for Event-level size information.
- log.h: added caerLogFileDescriptorsSet() to allow logging to
  up to two different file descriptors (defaults to STDERR only).
- davis.h: added chipID check macros.
- davis.h: added DAVIS_CONFIG_APS_SNAPSHOT to take one frame snapshots.
- dvs128.h: added DVS128_CONFIG_DVS_TS_MASTER to select timestamp
  master or slave behavior (timestamp synchronization).
- davis_common.c: added support for outputting only reset read or
  signal read frames, for debugging purposes.
- c11threads_posix.h: C11-compatible thread abstraction, for
  both Linux and MacOS X, based on POSIX Threads.

BUG FIXES
- Relaxed atomic operations memory constraints for better
  performance on weakly-ordered architectures (like ARM).
- log.c: call tzset() before localtime_r(), as per standard.
- davis_common.c: improved Region of Interest support (APS).
- davis_fx2.c: keep GlobalShutter flag correctly in-sync.
- davis_fx3.c: fixed support for new FX3 devices.
- packetContainer.h: handle container being NULL by returning NULL.


Release 1.0.0 - 02.10.2015
