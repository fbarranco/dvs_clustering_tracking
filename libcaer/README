libcaer
====

Minimal C library to access, configure and get data out of AER sensors,
such as the Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) or DAVIS cameras.

REQUIREMENTS:

cmake >= 2.6
gcc >= 4.9 or clang >= 3.6
libusb >= 1.0.17

Please make sure that you have the various development packages installed
for the above dependencies. They are usually called PKG-dev or PKG-devel.

INSTALLATION:

1) configure:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .

2) build:

$ make

3) install:

$ make install

DOCUMENTATION:

The API documentation for a release can be found at docs/libcaer_api_manual.pdf.
Also check the examples/ directory and the iniLabs Support website.

For the development tree, you can generate the documentation using:

$ make doc    - to generate docs/latex/ and docs/html/ documentation files.
$ make pdf    - to generate a PDF from the LaTeX sources at docs/latex/refman.pdf.

USAGE:

See examples/ directory. Usual usage is (simplified):

h = caerDeviceOpen(TYPE);
caerDeviceSendDefaultConfig(h);
caerDeviceDataStart(h);

loop:
	c = caerDeviceDataGet(h);
	work with c (container) and its event packets

caerDeviceDataStop(h);
caerDeviceClose(&h);

All configuration parameters and event types are specified in the
public headers and documented there.
